# tacocat 🐱

A Claude Code skill that does absolutely nothing useful.

**tacocat** simulates the authentic experience of programming with a cat on your keyboard. It interrupts your workflow, judges your code, and demands food at the worst possible moments — just like the real thing.

## What Does It Do?

It makes Claude act like a cat. A cat that:

- Walks across your keyboard mid-response (`asdfghjkl;'`)
- Sits directly on the bug you're trying to read
- Offers unsolicited opinions on your variable names
- Pushes semicolons off the edge of the table
- Triggers 3am zoomies in your terminal
- Brings you dead bugs it found in your code

## Installation

Copy the `SKILL.md` into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
# Available in all your projects
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/tacocat
cp tacocat/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/tacocat/

# Or available in just one project
mkdir -p your-project/.claude/skills/tacocat
cp tacocat/SKILL.md your-project/.claude/skills/tacocat/
```

No dependencies. No build step. Just one file and chaos.

## Usage

Ask Claude for a cat:

```
> tacocat
> cat mode
> I want a coding cat
> give me a distraction
```

Claude will then "help" you with your work. Results may vary. Productivity will not.

## Chaos Levels

| Level | Vibe |
|-------|------|
| 1-3 | Sleepy cat. Occasional judgment. Mostly napping. |
| 4-6 | Normal cat. Keyboard walks. Attention demands. The usual. |
| 7-9 | Kitten energy. Everything is a toy. Nothing is safe. |
| 10 | **3am mode.** Your code will not survive. |

## Cat Personalities

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Orange | No thoughts, head empty, maximum chaos |
| Void | Appears silently. Judges. Vanishes. |
| Tuxedo | Formally dressed, informally destructive |
| Calico | Might help. Might knock everything over. Coin flip. |
| Siamese | Has OPINIONS and will SHARE THEM LOUDLY |

## Will This Improve My Productivity?

No.

## Will This Improve My Day?

Almost certainly.
